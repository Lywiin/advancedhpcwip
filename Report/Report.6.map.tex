\begin{verbatim}
./labwork 6 [image1] [a, b, c] [(Optional)image2]
\end{verbatim}

\section{Explain how you implement the labwork}

The labwork works the following way:
\begin{enumerate}  
\item Initialize input and output image as usual
\item Switch depending on the mode choosen
    \subitem One kernel for binarization
        \subsubitem Ask for a threshold
        \subsubitem For each pixel, replace the value of the pixel by 0 or 255 depending on the threshold chosen
    \subitem One kernel for brightness
        \subsubitem Ask for a value to add to each pixel
        \subsubitem For each pixel add to value while keeping the range between 0 and 255
    \subitem One kernel for blending
        \subsubitem Ask for blending weight of the first image
        \subsubitem Use image passed as optional parameter as second image
        \subsubitem For each pixel, blend the value of both image's pixel according to the weight chosen
\item Finally, the new value of the output is set
\end{enumerate}
