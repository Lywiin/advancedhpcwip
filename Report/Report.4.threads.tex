\section{Explain how you improve the labwork}

I followed the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}  
\item Change blockSize and gridSize variable type to dim3
\item Calculate gridSize using image width and height
\item Change the kernel to know use the 2 dimensions to get each pixel
\end{enumerate}

\section{Try experimenting with different 2D block size values}

With block size of 32 it works well, however using block size like 64 or 128 it doesn't work anymore.


\section{Compare speedup with previous 1D grid}

Using 2D grid with blockSize of 32x32, the speed is actually a little bit faster than using 1D grid but not that much.
