\section{Explain how you implement the labwork}

I followed the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}  
\item Allocate variables devInput and devOutput using CudaMalloc
\item Copy data from host to device using CudaMemcpy
\item Launch the kernel
\item Copy back the memory from device to host
\item Then don't forget to free the 2 allocated variables
\end{enumerate}

\section{Whatâ€™s the speedup?}

About 110ms instead of 800ms before with openMP so about 7.2 times faster

\section{Try experimenting with different block size values}

Works with blockSize of 1024 but not 32 because the image is too big so the maximum dimension of the grid size exceeded
